# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm the creator of SIGAR

I develop minimalist and security-focused hardware tools using embedded systems and wireless technologies.

âš¡ **Currently working on SIGAR** â€“ a portable, app-controlled 5GHz WiFi analyzer built on the ESP32-C5.

ðŸ”§ The long-term goal:  
To create a **more powerful, focused alternative to Flipper Zero** â€“ designed for real-world wireless analysis, automation, and professional use.
